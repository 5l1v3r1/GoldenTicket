# GoldenTicket
 
This .NET assembly is specifically designed for creating Golden Tickets.  It has been built with a custom version of SharpSploit and an old 2.0 alpha (x64) version of Powerkatz.

This was a quick solution to the crashing that occurs with later versions of Mimi/Powerkatz in PE Loaders.

## Usage:
```
GoldenTicket.exe <username> <domain> <sid> <sids> <krbtgt>
```
